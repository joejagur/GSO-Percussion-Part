Hello future RIT GSO percussionists!

This is a program to ease the worries of "Rehersal starts in 10 minutes and we have no clue what we need". No additional coding needed! 

Parts 1 and 2 are steps you should redo with every new semester and/or part sheet.
Part 3 is how to run it on a daily basis.

1. Make sure your excel sheets are in this format

| Part Title  | Instrument | Other Columns |
| ----------- | ---------- | ----------- |
| Snare drum  |            |
| Percussion 1| Sus cymbal|
|             |Crash cymbal| 

As long as you have each sheet it should not matter what the content outside it is. The program will default to assuming the part title is the instrument unless it contains "Perc" in it in which case it will use the Instrument column
Ex. Percussion and Aux Perc 2 will both use the Instrument column

2. Download your percussion part assignment excel sheet as an ".xlxs" file. The name can be whatever you want, just make sure you know where you downloaded it to. 

3. Run the parts.exe file. If its your first time running the file it might take a minute to load up. Once it does a file explorer should pop up, locate your and select your Excel file.  Another pop up will appear with the songs

Enjoy!
